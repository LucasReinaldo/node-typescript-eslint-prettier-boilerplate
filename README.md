## ðŸ’» Project

Well, since I have to create a lot of new projects with pretty much the same configs, I decided to save a bit of my time.

If you are starting and don't know how to create a project on your own and config eslint, prettier, editorconfig I highly recommend you to give a try. But don't forget, look it up to know what's going on here. ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ¤” Benefits of using Prettier and ESLint

If you have set up Prettier, you can configure it to format your file on saving it. That way, you never need to worry about your code formatting anymore. Since Prettier is highly opinionated, you can do only minor configurations.
